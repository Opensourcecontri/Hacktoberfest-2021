If statement:
If statement is commonly used in programs coded in python and the strcture of if statement as follow:

if condition = value:

do something

elif condition = value:

do something

else:

do some thing





If name == “Alex”:

print(“Hi Alex”)

elif name == “Sara”:

print(“Hi Sara”)

elif name == “kate”:

print(“Hi Kate”)

else:

print(“Hi everybody”)



distance = input(“what is the distance of this road?”)

>>> what is the distance of this road?

25

msg= “this road 11 if distance == 20 else “this is another road”

>>>Print (msg)

we observe that user input distance = 25

So it will print :

this is another road




For Loop:

The for loop Looping through an iterable executes a block of code repeatedly until the condition in the for statement is no longer valid.



an iterable In Python refers to anything that can be looped over, such as a string, list or tuple.

The syntax for looping through an iterable is as follows:

for i in iterable:

print (i)





Example:

colors = [‘red', ‘yellow', ‘green', ‘blue‘, black]

for color in colors:

print (color)



1. we first declare the list of colors and give it the members ‘red', ‘yellow', ‘green', ‘blue‘, black.



2. Next the statement for color in colors, so the program loops through the colors list and assigns each member in the list to the variable color.



If you run the program, you’ll get

red

yellow

green

blue

black



the index of the members in the list can be displayed by use the enumerate() function.

for index, color in enumerate(colors):

print (index, color)

>>>0 red

1 yellow

2 green

3 blue

4 black





Looping through a sequence of numbers





Example :

loop through a string data.

msg = ‘Hi’

for i in msg:

print (i)



>>>H

i



range() function:

if start is not given, the numbers generated start from zero.

For instance,

range(5) will generate the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

range(3, 10) will generate [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

range(4, 10, 2) will generate [4, 6, 8]











the range() function works inside a for statement:

Example:



for i in range(3):

print (i)

>>>0

1

2






break: using break in for loop:

sometimes we want to stop the loop when meet specific certain condition so we use the break.

Example:

a = 0

for i in range(10):

a+= 2

print (‘i = ’, i, ‘, a= ’, a)

if a== 4:

break



we will get:

i = 0 , a = 2

i = 1 , a= 4



Without the break, the coder will loop from i = 0 to i = 10 because we used the function range(10).



However with the break keyword, the program ends prematurely at i = 2. This is because when i = 2, j reaches the value of 6 and the break keyword causes the loop to end.





continue: using continue in for loop:

We use continue to skip specific step in the iteration process.

Example:

for num in range(3)

if num == 1:

continue

print('Current number :', num)

Result: Current number : 0

Current number : 2









While Loop

while loop repeatedly executes code which inside the loop while specific condition remains valid.

Composition of while loop is as follow:

while condition is true:

do something

Firstly we declare a variable to function as a loop counter(variable counter)

The condition in which the while statement will evaluate the value of counter to determine if it something more than or less than, so the loop

will be executed.





Example:

>>>variable_count= 3

while variable_count > 0:

variable_count = variable_count - 1

print ("Variable_count =" , variable_count)



variable_count = 3

variable_count = 2

variable_count = 1









Continue: using continue in while loop:

We use continue to skip specific step in the iteration process of while loop.

Example:

num = 3

while num > 0:

num -= 1

if num == 1:

continue

print('Current number:', num)

Result: Current number : 0

Current number : 2







Zip( ) iterator examples:

print(list(zip(['red', 'yellow', 'green'], [1, 2, 3])))

>>>[('red ', 1), ('yellow ', 2), ('green', 3)]
colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'green']

nums = [1, 2, 3]

for color, num in zip(colors, nums):

print("{}: {}".format(color, num))

'red’: 1

'yellow': 2

'green': 3









Zip( ) iterator +* examples for lists : unzip nested lists

Eaxmple 3:

>>>colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'green']

>>>nums = [1, 2, 3]

>>>colors_list = [colors, nums]

>>>for colors, nums in zip(*colors_list):

print(colors, nums)

red 1

yellow 2

green 3

Zip( ) iterator+ * example for tuples: unzip nested tuples

>>>colors = ('red', 'yellow', 'green')

>>>nums = (1, 2, 3)

>>>colors_list = (colors, nums)

>>>for colors, nums in zip(*colors_list):

print(colors, nums)

red 1

yellow 2

green 3

enumerate( ) iterator: for lists:

It returns an iterator of tuples containing indices and values of a list. use this when you want the index along with each element of an iterable in a loop.
>>>letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

>>>for i, letter in enumerate(letters):

print(i, letter))
0 a
1 b
2 c
3 d
4 e

enumerate( ) iterator:for tuples

Example 2:

letters =('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e‘)
for i, letter in enumerate(letters):
print(i, letter)
0 a
1 b
2 c
3 d
4 e

Try, Except

This statement can take over how the program run when an error takes places: the code as following:

try:

do something

except:

do another action when an error takes place



Try, Except

Example:

try:
print(word)
except NameError:
print("Variable word is not defined")
except:
print("Something else went wrong")
